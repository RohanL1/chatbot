**Project Name**
## A chatbot application built using Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**Description**

This project deploys a chatbot application on AWS. The chatbot is powered by Amazon Bedrock, a service that  allows you to build natural language understanding and generation applications. The application is  deployed on an EC2 instance and is behind an Elastic Load Balancer for scalability. IAM is used to control access to the AWS resources.
